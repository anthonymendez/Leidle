<li>Naming of Professors or Students within the internal boards is strictly prohibited. Names with the first three characters starred will be permitted. E.g. John Smith → ***n ***th → Professor ***th</li>
<li>Verification for .edu emails and independent faculty must be truthful and reliable. Individuals are not allowed to use a .edu email or a faculty member’s information that is not theirs.</li>
<li>While we encourage all users to treat each other with respect and disagree with civility, opinions that are unpopular and make other users uncomfortable will not be removed. Discourse and contrasting opinions are the hallmarks of higher education, and we only intend to promote this diversity of opinion.</li>
<li>Deliberate posting of personal information (e.g home address, family info, cell phone number) in order to incite harassment and/or violence upon an individual or group is prohibited.</li>
<li>Any and all posts must not be in violation of local or federal United States law. Such posts that violate these laws will be reported to the authorities.</li>
<li>Images that are considered “not safe for work” or R rated will need to be tagged. Users are discouraged from posting the most grotesque content they can get their hands on, this isn’t 4chan.</li>
<li>Users are encouraged to produce high-quality and thought provoking content that contributes to a set discussion. Unintelligible posts and/or blatant spamming will not be allowed and will be subject to removal and potential user consequences.</li>
<li>Users are heavily encouraged to submit feedback and report content that is in violation with the rules. Quality feedback will be rewarded, however repeated reporting or feedback that is meant to be destructive or misleading is not allowed and may be subject to consequences.</li>
<li>The use of bots and proxies to deliberately evade spam and banning measures is also prohibited.</li>
<li>Anonymity is not an exemption from any of these rules. Anonymity is intended to improve discussion by allowing the user to have a more candid discussion without the influence of peer opinions and perception.</li>
<li>Specific boards will be allowed to enact board-specific rules. These rules will be done through the online polling of registered students/faculty.</li>
<li>The only globally banned word is the N word. While all other slurs are discouraged in the goal of quality content they will not be removed from discussion. Swearing is also permitted and will not receive any administrative backlash.</li>
<li>Rules are subject to change as feedback and user opinion alters. These changes will be made in accordance and with respect to our premise of being a free, local, and anonymous hub for discussion and expressive communities.</li>
