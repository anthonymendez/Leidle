<li><b>Why are you banning student and faculty names? Isn’t this place supposed to be less censored than everywhere else?</b><br />
This rule makes us unique as a site and would initially cause others to believe that Leidle is a heavily censored hub. However, this rule is specifically in place so we don’t have to censor the site further than what is outlined in the rules. If Leidle becomes a liberal or far-right hivemind, it is not our job to cease that sort of discussion. Our job is only to prevent dissenting opinions from getting shut down. With the banning of names we allow the users to focus on discussing ideas and events rather than focusing on specific individuals and opening the door for harassment and cyberbullying. While there are ways to circumvent this ban e.g “I hate the student body president”, we have reason to believe that this type of circumvention is much less prone to harassment. Individuals tend to identify this type of vague identification with ideas as opposed to the actual person discussed. We also believe that this removal will foster discussion among different schools and create a more inclusive atmosphere for inter-institutional discourse.</li><br />
 
<li><b>Are all names banned or just the names of students and faculty?</b><br />
Student and faculty names are the only banned names on Leidle. The names of politicians, celebrities, alumni, and regular individuals are all fair game to be discussed.</li><br />

<li><b>How will you enforce your rules?</b><br />
We strongly encourage users to point out and report broken rules. Quality reports will be acknowledged and rewarded accordingly. We have a three-tier hierarchy of moderation. We have moderators or <span style="color: blue;">mods</span> which are usually in charge of a single school or state. <span style="color: yellow;">Supermods</span> are usually in charge of a region and have greater oversight. <span style="color: red;">Admins</span> have even greater oversight and are able to alter website design. We have public modlogs to prevent moderator abuse and because moderators+ will have to relinquish some degree of anonymity, they can be reported on by users if they are not adhering to the rules. Reporting a moderator+ will be as anonymous as possible and will not be tied to any single user. Our team is engaged and only wants the best for the site, even if we have to let some inflammatory content slide. If opinions are conflicting, we will tend to stand on the side of free speech, however any blatant violations will be caught by our team as quickly as possible.</li><br />
 
<li><b>Will you be expanding to more schools?</b><br />
Yes, ideally we would like Leidle to be used in every higher learning institution nationwide and possibly internationally. Our expansion at first will be limited to individual schools, schools where we feel that we can provide a quality service combined with diligent moderation and actual feedback from attending students. Eventually our expansions will be made statewide and all the schools from that respective state will be added to the consortium of discussion hubs.</li><br />
 
<li><b>Why did you make Leidle?</b><br />
Leidle is first and foremost intended to assist the students attending their alma mater. There is a serious free speech problem on college campuses nowadays. While one might think that this only applies to political discourse, and that is certainly an aspect of it, we encourage users to call out faults with their own alma mater if they feel it is appropriate to do so. Informing other users about serious issues such as mental health facilities, or lack thereof, not only allows incoming students to make informed decisions about their school choice, but it pushes the administrative body to resolve these issues in a manner that a single student or donor voice cannot.</li><br />
 
<li><b>Aren’t there other means online to discuss higher education? What makes Leidle different?</b><br />
Other sites simply lack the anonymity, moderation,posting design, and unique rules that Leidle possesses. A lack of up voting or karma system allows relevant threads to be circulated much quicker among the student body, while the use of “thank yous” can often highlight relevant posts and comments without the hivemind mentality. The selective use of anonymity is also unique to Leidle. A user can post anonymously but have a verified student flair to distinguish themselves from a possible troll attending a rival school. All in all, traditional forum mechanics do not lend well to the expedited means of discussion that Leidle hopes to achieve, while typical anonymous only forums tend to lack the means of user distinguishing needed to oust trolls and proper moderation to prevent site-clogging spam.</li><br />
 
<li><b>What are pickets and how do I use them?</b><br />
Pickets are a method of adding individuality and resonance to your post. They can be used for anything from advertising a club to sharing a couple of campus pictures that you liked. Pickets have a maximum of 9 allowable images and links to albums are also permitted within the text boxes. There are a variety of fonts, designs, flairs, and borders available to default registered users, and, as you post more and gains more “rep”, more cosmetic features will be unlocked. They are meant to be used as a thread starter but the original poster can also post follow-up pickets within their thread as well as receive picket replies. Due to site loading concerns, we do limit the amount of animated images (gifs, webms, avis) to one per picket.</li><br />
